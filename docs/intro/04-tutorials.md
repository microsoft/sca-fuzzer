# Starting with Tutorials

Let's learn by example.

This is a starting point for a tutorial series that will teach you how to use Revizor for testing CPUs, from the most basic cases, to detection of Spectre and Meltdown, to building custom campaigns for detecting new vulnerabilities, and up to building custom extensions for Revizor for the most advanced cases.

## How the Documentation is Organized

Revizor's documentation is organized into five distinct categories based on your needs:

### Learning-Oriented: Tutorials

Tutorials take you by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project. They are designed for newcomers who want to get started with Revizor. Start here if you're learning.

* [Main Tutorial Series](intro/04_tutorials_start.md): Follow a series of hands-on tutorials that walk you through running your first tests, detecting violations, and rump up all the way to root-cause analysis and design of custom campaigns.
* [How TSA-SQ Was Detected](intro/tsa-sq.md): A practical case study showing how Revizor was used to discover the TSA-SQ vulnerability. For those interested in how Revizor is used in the real world.

### Task-Oriented: How-To Guides

How-to guides are recipes that guide you through steps to solve specific problems. They assume you have basic knowledge and want to accomplish something particular.

* [How to Choose a Contract](howto/choose-contract.md) - Select appropriate reference model
* [How to Design a Fuzzing Campaign](howto/design-campaign.md) - Plan effective testing strategies
* [How to Interpret Results](howto/interpret-results.md) - Understand what the outputs mean
* [How to Minimize Violations](howto/minimize.md) - Reduce test cases to essentials
* [How to Root-Cause a Violation](howto/root-cause-a-violation.md) - Analyze and understand detected leaks
* [How to Use Macros](howto/use-macros.md) - Leverage macros for customizing test cases
* [How to Use Templates](howto/use-templates.md) - Create structured test cases with templates

---

### Understanding-Oriented: Topic Guides

Topic guides provide background and explanation to help you understand how Revizor works. They don't contain step-by-step instructions but explain key concepts in depth.

* [Leakage Contracts](topics/contracts.md) - Understanding security specifications
* [Actors and Isolation](topics/actors.md) - Multi-domain testing concepts
* [Leakage Models](topics/models.md) - How the model predicts CPU behavior
* [Test Case Generation](topics/test-case-generation.md) - Code and data generation explained
* [Trace Analysis](topics/trace-analysis.md) - How violations are detected

---

### Information-Oriented: Reference

Reference guides contain technical descriptions of Revizor's components. They're like a dictionary—useful when you know what you're looking for.

* [Command Line Interface](ref/cli.md) - Complete CLI reference
* [Configuration Options](ref/config.md) - All configuration parameters
* [Execution Modes](ref/modes.md) - Fuzz, reproduce, analyze, minimize
* [Macros Reference](ref/macros.md) - Template macro system
* [Minimization Passes](ref/minimization-passes.md) - Available minimization techniques
* [Runtime Statistics](ref/runtime-statistic.md) - Runtime metrics printed during execution
* [Binary Format](ref/binary-formats.md) - (advanced) Revizor's custom binary format
* [Allocated Registers](ref/registers.md) - (advanced) Register allocation details
* [Sandbox](ref/sandbox.md) - (advanced) Sandbox for executing test cases

---

### Contributor-Oriented: Development Guides

Development guides help contributors understand the codebase, architecture, and development practices.

* [Developer Index](internals/index.md)
* [Architecture Overview](internals/architecture/overview.md)
* [Code Style Guidelines](internals/contributing/guidelines-code-style.md)
* [Git Conventions](internals/contributing/guidelines-git.md)

## Research and Background

Revizor is built on peer-reviewed research in hardware security and formal methods:

1. Original paper that introduced the concept of Model-based Relation Testing as well as the Revizor tool: "[Revizor: Testing Black-box CPUs against Speculation Contracts](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/revizor-testing-black-box-cpus-against-speculation-contracts/)"
2. Theoretical foundations of leakage contract: "[Hardware-software contracts for secure speculation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/hardware-software-contracts-for-secure-speculation/)"
3. Accessible summary of the two papers above, in a journal format: "Revizor: Testing Black-box CPUs against Speculation Contracts". In IEEE Micro, 2023.
4. Paper that introduced speculation filtering, observation filtering, and contract-based input generation: "[Hide and Seek with Spectres: Efficient discovery of speculative information leaks with random testing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/hide-and-seek-with-spectres-efficient-discovery-of-speculative-information-leaks-with-random-testing/)"
5. Paper that introduced exception-based testing (i.e., focus on Meltdown, Foreshadow) into Revizor: "[Speculation at Fault: Modeling and Testing Microarchitectural Leakage of CPU Exceptions.](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/hofmann)"
6. Paper that introduced testing of cross-VM and user-kernel leaks in Revizor, as well as presented TSA attacks on AMD CPUs: "[Enter, Exit, Page Fault, Leak: Testing Isolation Boundaries for Microarchitectural Leaks](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Enter-Exit-SP26.pdf)"
